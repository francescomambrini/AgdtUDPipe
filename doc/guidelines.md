# Guidelines
This document details the guidelines for morphosyntactic annotation that were followed
for this fork of the [Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank]().

In general, the same annotation rules and principles as the AGDT (v 1.7) will be followed.
We discuss here only the case where some additional details add to be specified,
or where some corrections had to be made to the original annotation.

## Morphological analysis and Lemmatization

### Irregular comparatives and superlatives
Lemmatize irregular (i.e. polytematic) comparatives and superlatives under themselves; the proper
degree (comp. or sup.) must be marked in the appropriate position of the pos-tag.

### Special words

#### ὡς

#### καί

#### μᾶλλον and μάλιστα
μᾶλλον and μάλιστα must be lemmatized under μᾶλλον and μάλιστα, and tagged as comparative
and superlative respectively.

## Syntax

### Special cases

#### "Raised" objects

"Predicative" construction, where one of the arguments of the subordinate clause is "raised" 
and become argument of the main verb, are rather frequent in Greek.

One type of "raised" predicatives is represented by so called "predicative participles" 
in accusative (or genitive/dative, depending on the case governed by the head verb). See 
Soph. *Aj* 3-6:

```
 καὶ νῦν ἐπὶ σκηναῖς σε ναυτικαῖς ὁρῶ Αἴαντος [...] πάλαι κυνηγετοῦντα καὶ μετρούμενον ἴχνη

```

(Note that English has a similar "raised" construction with the verb "to see": "I see you chasing and measuring the tracks")

In this construction, the bivalent verb ὁράω receives a supplementary argument in the form of a participle, specifying 
the actions that the verb's objects is seen doing. Note that, with many verbs that are contructed with predicative participles 
of the object, the accusative/infintive construction is often also attested (for ὁράω, see [LSJ](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oraw&la=greek#lexicon), II.d ).

A similar case, though less frequently attested and more irregular, is met when the subject of 
a subordinate clause is "raised" and becomes the objects of the verb that governs the subordinate. 
Sophocles in particular is rather fond of this construction. See for instance Soph. *Aj* 334-5:
 
 ```
 ἢ οὐκ ἠκούσατε Αἴαντος οἵαν τήνδε θωΰσσει βοήν; 
 
 ```

Note here that Αἴαντος is not only raised from the position of subject of the interrogative clause, so as to fill 
an additional role of the verb ἀκούω. It also acquires the genitive case, which is the proper case required by the verb.
 
Commentaries and grammars often refers to these arguments objects in "apposition" or "justapposed". However, 
the construction is a case of argument "raising" (while the annotation as apposition - with `OBJ_AP` would be wrong 
as the two arguemnts do not have the same semantic reference).

Tim Osborne and Matthew Reeve (see [here](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-6521)) have reviewed the different options to formalize these constructions in a Dependency Grammar. 
Here, we follow their suggestion: we attach both the "raised" and the proper argument to the governing verb. Osborne and Reeve do not discuss the 
question of how to lable the arguments. A construction with two `OBJ`s would not work, as the two complements cannot be considered two independent and external arguments of the verb.

We decided to extend the use of the label `OCOMP` to tag also this peculiar type of verb complement.

**To sum up**: consturctions with verbs and raised arguments - where a supplementary argument of a governing verb is raised from an embedded predication - 
are annotated as follows: both the raised and "proper" argument (generally represented by the verb of a subordinate clause or participle) are attached to the verb; 
The "raised" argument is annotated as `OBJ`, while the other (which ends up occupying the position of a predicative object complement) is annotated as `OCOMP`.

#### Predicative participles in nominative (as in "λάθε βιώσας")

This is a famous peculiar construction of Greek. First-year students learn that, with some verbs (as φαίνω, λανθάνω, τυγχάνω etc.), 
the main semantic weight of the action, event or state of affair is put on the joining participle, while the main verb 
only adds a sort of a modality trait (pubblicity or hiddenness of the action, accidentality etc.). In a traslation, 
the participle typically becomes the main verb, while the Greek main verb is rendered with an adverb (e.g. φαίνω: 'visibly', 'manifestly').

Although the semantic weight is peculiarly distributed between main verb and participle, from the standpoint of syntax there is no reason not to annotate similar sentences with 
the usual syntactic structure reserved to verb + nominative participles. In other word, the verbs φαίνω, λανθάνω, τυγχάνω etc. is annotated according to its syntactic function (e.g. `PRED`, `OBJ`, `ATR` etc), while the participle is regularly tagged as `ADV`.

#### Predicative participles in accusative (or indirect cases)
The participle is tagged as `OCOMP`: see above under `"Raised" objects".

#### ἔχω + adverb

When adverbs are joined with the verb ἔχειν (with the meaning: "being in a certain condition", cf. Italian "stare (bene o male)"), they must be annotated as `ADV`, not `OBJ`.

#### Genitives with exclamation

It's a genitive of cause ("alas for..."), thus `ADV` attached to the exclamation. See e.g. *Aj* 366: ὤμοι γέλωτος (`ExD --> ADV`).

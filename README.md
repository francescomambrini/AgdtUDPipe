# AgdtUDPipe

## What is it?

A few scripts and classes to use UDPipe, UD-API and CoNLL-U with Perseus' 
[Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank](https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/).

## How to use it

Apart from a few Python modules imported here and there (which can be installed 
with `pip`), this project requires:
* my [perseus-nlp-toolkit](https://github.com/francescomambrini/PerseusNLPToolkit)
* the language models for UD-Pipe (see [here](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe#language_models))
